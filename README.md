# A simple tribute page describing the life of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.

My first project, built with HTML and CSS. This project is created as a part of the freeCodeCamp [curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). See it live here.
